these two script perform the same task.

Merge the polygons that are overlaping eachother in the same shapefile.
It takes a lot of time for big shapes with lots of polygons.

both of them work fine with python 2 and python 3.

merge_over_func.py takes two arguments (the name of the shape file and the name of the outdir/file)
ex: python3 merge_over_func.py small.shp experiment1

v2_merge_over.py (this one is the same code, but it needs those parameters to be configured)
