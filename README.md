# Shape-Processing
Here are some codes to process shape files in python

There are a group of folders that contain the codes, the instructions and some files to run the scripts
the folders are:
- Delete_overlaping : Here You can delete polygons that overlap with polygons or are inside the buffer of a line.
- Filter_by_size : Here You can delete polygons of one shape file that are bigger or smaller than a given threshold.
- Meger_Overlaping : Here You can merge the polygons of one shape file that are overlapping.

and there is a file called: "GDAL-2.3.0-cp27-cp27mu-manylinux1_x86_64.whl" this file is a wheel to install gdal for python2
